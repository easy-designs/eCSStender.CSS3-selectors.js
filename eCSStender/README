== eCSStender

The web is constantly changing and yet weâ€™ve been using CSS in pretty
much the same way for nearly a decade.

eCSStender changes all of that.

For more information, see http://eCSStender.org

== What's new in this release?

See the CHANGELOG file for information on what's new.

== Installation/Usage

Put eCSStender.js in a directory on your website, e.g. /js.

Now, you can include the scripts by adding the following 
tags to your HTML pages:

 <script src="/js/eCSStender.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

eCSStender does nothing on it's own, but it facilitates the use of
eCSStensions developed by the community. Some eCSStensions do simple
things like reduce your dependence on proprietary CSS extensions like
-moz-border-radius; others push CSS beyond the spec and pave the way
for future iterations of the language.

== The distribution

Besides the eCSStender files in src, there's a complete
test tree included which holds assorted tests for eCSStender.

If you need examples on how to implement things, we suggest opening 
tests/index.html (in your browser) and browsing the examples 
provided.
